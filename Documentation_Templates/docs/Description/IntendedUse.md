The intended use of the ECMO system is the extra-corporal handling of human blood, mainly for oxygenation. This supports or replaces the function of the human lung, the heart or both. Therefore, blood is transported via a pump to a special membrane which, simplified spoken, removes CO2 from and adds O2 to the blood. From our side of the whole system we control the speed of the blood pump(s) and measure vital indicators, which are partly processed for the control process and partly presented to the (medical) [user](../Roles/User.md) who makes therapeutical decisions based on these values. From this perspective the system can be described by the following graph:
![IntendedUse](../Diagrams/rendered/IntendedUse.svg)

Following the arrow directions the flow of control (red arrows) and information (blue arrows) can already be seen. The transport of control and information is taken care of by the [Inter Planetary Communication](../skeleton_md/InterPlanetaryCommunication/InterPlanetaryCommunication.md).

This is the bird's eye perspective. Now, the pump(s) and the blood tube(s) themselves are outside the scope for us this project. They are taken care of by the customer. Nevertheless, all components are described on following sites.
