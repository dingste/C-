### Function naming

The scope of a function has to be as narrow and unique as possible. This implies functionality and code length. This should be expressed in its name as well. Thus, only a minimal ruleset or paradigm is necessary to build a function name. The English language makes it simple to express a special meaning, by Prefix + Object + Verb. For example:

| Prefix    | Object       | Verb    | Result                      |
| --------- | ------------ | ------- | --------------------------- |
| on        | OkButton     | pressed | onOkButtonPressed()         |
| do        | CancelButton | change  | doCancelButtonChange()      |
| condition | AnyButton    | pressed | conditionAnyButtonPressed() |

Argument and return value naming follow suite. Their names have to be as precise and short as possible. They have to follow the conventions which are given in the chapter about variable and type naming.
